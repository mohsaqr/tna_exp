\usage{
bootstrap(x, ...)

\method{bootstrap}{tna}(x, iter = 1000, level = 0.05, threshold, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tna} object created from sequence data.}

\item{...}{Ingored.}

\item{iter}{An \code{integer} specifying the number of bootstrap samples to
draw. Defaults to \code{1000}.}

\item{level}{A \code{numeric} value representing the significance level for
hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{threshold}{A \code{numeric} value to compare edge weights against.
The default is the 10th percentile of the edge weights.}
}
\value{
A \code{tna_bootstrap} object which is a \code{list} containing the
following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{original_weights}: The original weights \code{matrix} for the selected
cluster.
\item \code{mean_weights}: The mean weight \code{matrix} from the bootstrap samples.
\item \code{sd_weights}: The standard deviation \code{matrix} from the bootstrap samples.
\item \code{ci_lower}: The lower bound \code{matrix} of the confidence intervals for
the transitions.
\item \code{ci_upper}: The upper bound \code{matrix} of the confidence intervals for
the transitions.
\item \code{p_values}: The \code{matrix} of p-values for the transitions.
\item \code{sig_weight}: The \code{matrix} of significant transitions
(those with p-values below the significance level).
\item \code{combined}: A \code{data.frame} summarizing the transitions, their weights,
p-values, and confidence intervals.
\item \code{removed_edges_summary}: A list summarizing the number of removed edges
(insignificant transitions), the mean and standard deviation of their
weights, and the range of the removed edge weights.
}
}
\description{
Perform bootstrapping on transition networks created from
sequence data stored in a \code{tna} object. Bootstrapped estimates
of edge weights are returned with confidence intervals and significance
testing.
}
\details{
The function first computes the original edge weights for the specified
cluster from the \code{tna} object. It then performs bootstrapping by resampling
the sequence data and recalculating the edge weights for each
bootstrap sample. The mean and standard deviation of the transitions are
computed, and confidence intervals are derived. The function also calculates
p-values for each edge and identifies significant edges based on
the specified significance level. A matrix of significant edges
(those with p-values below the significance level) is generated.
Additional statistics on removed edges (those not considered
significant) are provided.

All results, including the original transition matrix, bootstrapped
estimates, and summary statistics for removed edges, are returned in a
structured list.
