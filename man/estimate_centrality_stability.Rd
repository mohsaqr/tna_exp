\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tna} object representing the temporal network analysis data. The object should be created from a \code{TraMineR} sequence object.}

\item{cluster}{An integer specifying the cluster of the \code{tna} object to analyze. Default is 1.}

\item{measures}{A character vector of centrality measures to estimate. The default measures are \code{"InStrength"}, \code{"OutStrength"}, and \code{"Betweenness"}.}

\item{normalize}{A logical value indicating whether to normalize the centrality measures. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{n_bootstraps}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap resamples to perform. Default is 1000.}

\item{drop_proportions}{A numeric vector specifying the proportions of cases to drop in each bootstrap iteration. Default is a sequence from 0.1 to 0.9 in increments of 0.1.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the correlation threshold for calculating the CS-coefficient. Default is 0.7.}

\item{certainty}{A numeric value specifying the desired level of certainty for the CS-coefficient. Default is 0.95.}

\item{n_cores}{An integer specifying the number of cores to use for parallel processing. The default is the number of detected cores minus one.}

\item{return_detailed}{A logical value specifying whether to return detailed bootstrap results. If \code{TRUE}, detailed results are included in the output. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plot}{A logical value specifying whether to generate a plot of the stability results. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{cs_coefficient}: The centrality stability (CS) coefficient for each measure.
\item \code{correlations}: A matrix of correlations between the original centrality and the resampled centralities for each drop proportion.
\item \code{detailed_results}: A detailed data frame of the bootstrap correlations, returned if \code{return_detailed = TRUE}.
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the stability of centrality measures in a network using bootstrap resampling. It allows for dropping varying proportions of cases and calculates correlations between the original centralities and bootstrapped subsets. The function supports parallel processing to speed up the computations.
}
\details{
The function works by repeatedly resampling the data, dropping varying proportions of cases, and calculating centrality measures on the subsets. The correlation between the original centralities and the resampled centralities is calculated for each drop proportion. The stability of each centrality measure is then summarized using a centrality stability (CS) coefficient, which represents the proportion of dropped cases at which the correlations drop below a given threshold (default 0.7).

The function uses parallel processing to speed up the resampling procedure, with the number of cores specified by the \code{n_cores} argument.

The results can be visualized with an optional plot showing the stability of the centrality measures across different drop proportions, along with confidence intervals. The CS-coefficients are displayed in the plot's subtitle.
