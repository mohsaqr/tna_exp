\usage{
bootstrap_tna(x, n_bootstrap = 1000, sig_level = 0.05, cluster = 1, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tna} object created from the sequence data.}

\item{n_bootstrap}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples to
be generated. Defaults to \code{1000}.}

\item{sig_level}{A numeric value representing the significance level for
hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{cluster}{An integer specifying which cluster of the sequence data to
use for bootstrapping. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{seed}{Establish seed before bootstrapping}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{model}: A new \code{tna} object based on the significant transition matrix.
\item \code{results}: A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{original_trans_matrix}: The original transition matrix for the selected cluster.
\item \code{mean_trans_matrix}: The mean transition matrix from the bootstrap samples.
\item \code{sd_trans_matrix}: The standard deviation of the transition matrix from the bootstrap samples.
\item \code{ci_lower_matrix}: The lower bound of the confidence intervals for the transitions.
\item \code{ci_upper_matrix}: The upper bound of the confidence intervals for the transitions.
\item \code{p_values_matrix}: The matrix of p-values for the transitions.
\item \code{significant_trans_matrix}: The matrix of significant transitions (those with p-values below the significance level).
\item \code{combined_df}: A data frame summarizing the transitions, their weights, p-values, and confidence intervals.
\item \code{removed_edges_summary}: A list summarizing the number of removed edges (insignificant transitions), the mean and standard deviation of their weights, and the range of the removed edge weights.

\description{
This function performs bootstrapping on transition networks created from
sequence data stored in a \code{tna} object. It resamples the sequences,
computes transition matrices, and returns bootstrapped estimates
of transitions with confidence intervals and significance testing.
}
\details{
The function first computes the original transition matrix for the specified
cluster from the \code{tna} object. It then performs bootstrapping by resampling
the sequence data and recalculating the transition matrices for each bootstrap
sample. The mean and standard deviation of the transitions are computed, and
confidence intervals are derived. The function also calculates p-values for each
transition and identifies significant transitions based on the specified
significance level. A matrix of significant transitions (those with p-values
below the significance level) is generated. Additional statistics on removed
edges (transitions not considered significant) are provided.

All results, including the original transition matrix, bootstrapped estimates, and summary statistics for removed edges, are returned in a structured list.
