Description: Provides tools for performing transition network analysis (TNA),
    including functions for building TNA models, plotting transition networks,
    and calculating centrality measures. The package relies on 'TraMineR' 
    for sequence analysis, as well as 'qgraph', 'igraph' for network plotting 
    and centrality measure calculation.
