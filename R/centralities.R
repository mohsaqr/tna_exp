#' Calculate Centralities for a Transition Matrix
#'
#' This function calculates several centrality measures using the \code{igraph}, \code{NetworkToolbox}, \code{keyplayer}, and \code{qgraph} packages.
#' The measures include:
#'
#'   * `OutStrength` Outgoing strength centrality, calculated using [igraph::strength()] with `mode = "out"`.
#'     It measures the total weight of the outgoing edges from each node.
#'   * `InStrength` Incoming strength centrality, calculated using [igraph::strength()] with `mode = "in"`.
#'     It measures the total weight of the incoming edges to each node.
#'   * `ClosenessIn` Closeness centrality (incoming), calculated using [igraph::closeness()] with `mode = "in"`.
#'     It measures how close a node is to all other nodes based on the incoming paths.
#'   * `ClosenessOut` Closeness centrality (outgoing), calculated using [igraph::closeness()] with `mode = "out"`.
#'     It measures how close a node is to all other nodes based on the outgoing paths.
#'   * `Closeness` Closeness centrality (overall), calculated using [igraph::closeness()] with `mode = "all"`.
#'     It measures how close a node is to all other nodes based on both incoming and outgoing paths.
#'   * `Betweenness` Betweenness centrality based on randomized shortest paths (Kivim√§ki et al. 2014).
#'     It measures the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes.
#'   * `Diffusion` Diffusion centrality of Banerjee et.al. (2014).
#'     It measures the influence of a node in spreading information through the network.
#'   * `Clustering` Signed clustering coefficient of Zhang and Horvath (2005)
#'     based on the symmetric adjacency matrix (sum of the adjacency matrix and its transpose).
#'     It measures the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together.
